The development is currently on hold, and we will continue it by the end of September.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

we want to collect course reviews from students who have already taken this course, sp we can make our decision whether to take it or not

For this project, we were interested to know: 

1. How did you like the course. Give an overall rating.
2. What is the workload of this course, as far as exercises and the final exam?
3. How is the lecture and teaching staff?
4. What are the pros and cons of the course?
5. Do you recommend this course?

So far we have not seen any relevant apps that are doing it in Germany. So we will consider turn it into a general purpose app so that it can be used in other universities.
